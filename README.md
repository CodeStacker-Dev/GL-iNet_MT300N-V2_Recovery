# GL-iNet_MT300N-V2_Factory
This repository is dedicated to providing a reliable source for the factory original uboot, firmware, and WiFi radio drivers for the GL.iNet MT300N-V2 ("Mango") router. The goal is to assist users who may have bricked, modified, or otherwise altered their device and wish to revert it to its original state.

Why This Repository Was Created

Finding factory-original firmware, uboot, and drivers for the GL.iNet MT300N-V2 router can be a challenging and frustrating process. Many users have reported difficulty locating genuine files directly from the manufacturer or other reliable sources. While some community-contributed resources exist, they may not always be complete, up-to-date, or trustworthy.

This repository was created out of necessity and a desire to help others in the same situation. After struggling to locate original files for my own device, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I purchased a new, factory-sealed unit of the GL.iNet MT300N-V2 from Amazon specifically to create a clean, untouched backup of the original firmware, uboot, and drivers.

What This Repository Offers

The repository contains the following:

Factory-original firmware images: Verified and unmodified, exactly as they come from the manufacturer.

Original uboot: Essential for recovery in case of bootloader corruption or other critical issues.

WiFi radio drivers: For restoring wireless functionality if modified or custom drivers cause issues.

Tools and documentation: Including flashing tools and step-by-step guides for recovering your device.


Who This Repository is For

This repository is designed for:

Users who accidentally brick their device during experimentation, firmware upgrades, or modifications.

Developers and enthusiasts who want a reliable backup to fall back on.

Anyone seeking to restore their router to its original factory state.


A Note on Responsibility

While this repository provides all the necessary tools and files for recovery, it is important to note that flashing firmware or modifying a router involves risks. Users are responsible for their actions, and the maintainers of this repository cannot be held liable for any damage or issues that may arise.

Contributions and Community Support

This repository is a community effort, and contributions are welcome. If you have additional tools, documentation, or files to share, please submit a pull request or open an issue.

Closing Thoughts

By sharing this repository, I hope to save others the time and frustration I experienced when trying to recover my own router. The GL.iNet MT300N-V2 is a versatile and powerful little device, and with the right tools, it can continue to serve its users reliably for years to come
