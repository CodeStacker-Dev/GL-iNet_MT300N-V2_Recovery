## 🎯 Why This Repository Was Created

Finding factory-original firmware, uboot, drivers, and the official GL.iNet GUI for the GL.iNet MT300N-V2 router can be a challenging and frustrating process.

While community-contributed resources exist, they can often be incomplete, outdated, or unreliable.

**This repository was born out of necessity**. After struggling to locate original files for my own device, I purchased a new, factory-sealed GL.iNet MT300N-V2 from Amazon to create a clean, untouched backup of the original firmware, uboot, GUI, and drivers.
